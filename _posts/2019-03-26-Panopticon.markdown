description: Panopticon is a 2D Platformer made by the graduate level game lab program at UTD. I primarily worked as an engineer on the project, and was responsible for player input, character mechanics, and the animation controller for the character. These tasks required heavy collaboration with our level designer, game designer, and our animator.
