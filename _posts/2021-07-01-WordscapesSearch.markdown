description: Fate is a digital collectable card game that uniquely mixes multiple genres into one. It won the UTD Best Capstone 2018 Award. I spent a little less than two years designing Fate and I decided to create a full vertical slice of gameplay for my Arts and Technology capstone project. The prototype was made over the course of one semester, and I implemeneted every feature from the physical version of the game.
