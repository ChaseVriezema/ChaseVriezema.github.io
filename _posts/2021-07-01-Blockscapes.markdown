description: Blockscapes is a mobile game created by PeopleFun where you arrange blocks within a grid to fill rows and cause the blocks to disappear. This was one of the projects in our 'core swap' program at the time where we took common features from multiple games (menus, IAP framework and ad systems) and swapped the core gameplay to rapidly prototype ideas. My contributions on this project mainly revolve around the shop screen which was redone from the ground up to integrate AB testing into our IAPs and as well as make use of new Unity UI features.
