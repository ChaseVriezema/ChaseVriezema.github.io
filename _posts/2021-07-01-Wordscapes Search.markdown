description: Wordscapes Search is a mobile game for iOS and Android based around simple Wordsearch Gameplay. I worked on the project from it's beta stages to supporting it with post launch content and contributed to most of it's features during that time. I was able to spearhead development on certain features such as introducing various gamemodes, its collectable items system and its timed events. I worked on a team that ranged from 5 people at its smallest to around 15 people at its largest, and contributed to sprint planning and maintaining the codebase.
