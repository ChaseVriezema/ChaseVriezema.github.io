description: Coinsplash is a slots based business management game that I worked on for a year during its softlaunch lifetime. I was on a team of two other people, and contributed majorly to many of the features and fixes we implemented in the game. I helped build its analytics system, ad management system, IAP system and many different gameplay features while I was there. I also spearheaded many efforts to improve the maintainability and extensability of our codebase, as well as handle many of our optimization challenges such as speeding up loadtimes and handling latency on network calls.
